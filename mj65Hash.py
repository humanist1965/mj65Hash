"""
Hash class.

Wrote this Nov 2015 as part of my ongoing exercise to learn python.

Had fun writing it but not sure how safe it is??
That's why you would normally use a proven crypto hash function developed by mathematicians.

From basic tests I have performed though it seems to be producing relatively random results
for each input string passed.

I have also tested it over 100K iterations to prove the it doesn't generate the same hash twice.

At some point I plan to study the SHA1 (SHA256) algorithms to see the approach they take and how it differs from mine.

Tested using Python 3.4.1
